# NNs_ImageClassification
 
## Project Description
This project focuses on using neural networks to optimize model performance in correctly identifying whether an image is an object or an non-object using the CIFAR-10 image data set. The goal is to determine whether the computer model can outperform a human when using website protection measures of determining "I'm not a robot." prompts.

## Affilation
This group project conducted for the Unversity of Notre Dame's Statistical Learning for Data Science course taught by Dr. Brian Naughton, where I was the team leader of three people. 

## Futhermore
The project is currently in progress, where I solely plan to extend the project further.
